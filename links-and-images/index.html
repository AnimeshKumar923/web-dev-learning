    <h2>Absolute Links</h2>
    <p>
      Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute
      links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts:
      [protocol://domain/path.] An absolute link will always contain the
      protocol and domain of the destination.
    </p>

    <h2>Relative Links</h2>
    <p>
      Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links.
      Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on
      the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we
      created the link on.
